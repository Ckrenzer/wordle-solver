# About
Learning the syntax of a programming language is something best learned through experience. I usually have a sense for how R behaves, with almost every data structure being implemented with arrays and there being only four useful data types ('character', 'logical', 'integer', 'double'). Copy-on-modify semantics and the quote from John Chambers, "everything that exists in R is an object, and everything that happens is a function," allow users to draft up pretty coherent guiding principles when studying code.

Among other things, Julia attempts to retain the straighforwardness of R while providing more control to the developer. The Wordle solver will, hopefully, give me some insights into these changes of behavior.
