# About
Uses information theory to solve Wordle puzzles, inspired by [3Blue1Brown's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA).

# Motivations
I made this repo as a Julia learning exercise.

Learning the syntax of a programming language is something best learned through experience. I usually have a sense for how R behaves, with almost every data structure being implemented with arrays and there being only four useful data types ('character', 'logical', 'integer', 'double'). Copy-on-modify semantics and the quote from John Chambers, "Everything that exists is an object. Everything that happens is a function call." allow users to draft up pretty coherent guiding principles when studying code.

Among other things, Julia attempts to retain the straighforwardness of R while providing more control to the developer. The Wordle solver will, hopefully, give me some insights into these changes of behavior.
